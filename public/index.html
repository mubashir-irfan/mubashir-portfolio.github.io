              the teammates. I believe in delivering work that generates value
              at the user's end, and productivity at my team's end. I prioritize
              being a team-player who delivers not only the code, but also his
              share towards ensuring a culture of engineering-excellence - a
              culture that delivers peace of mind, and heart, to the ones
              embedded in it.

                At LocAI, I am serving as a Senior Software Engineer (Frontend).

              </p>
              <p>
                My role involves collaborating cross-functionally with Product,
                Design, Backend and QA Teams to realize the product roadmap. I
                joined the codebase in its birth month and was assigned the core
                responsibilites of laying and strengthening the ground work. I
                got to write custom authentication of the codebase, which is
                responsibile for authentication and authorization of the user
                session. I developed the engagement tracking pipeline using
                custom events sent to Rudderstack, which then reverse-ETLs them
                to Mixpanel and Google Analytics. I designed and developed the
                architecture of communicating with Backend via React Query by
                writing custom hooks that encapsulate repetitive operations of
                triggering, managing state of and responding to the errors
                generated by API invocations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the application evolved, we implemented Internationalization
                to ensure native UAE users could use the application in Arabic.
                I conducted the effort of centralising the application's source
                of strings based on user's choice of language, and coordinated
                with Translation team to extract, translate and re-inject the
                large set of strings in an efficient manner. I also implemented
                a light-dark mode theme switcher, to further enhance the UX.

                I was hired at Careem to develop the Careem Bikes Dashboard
                in-house. I, aided by my amazing colleague Yahya from Jordan,
                developed the dashboard using NextJS and TailwindCSS.

                During my time, we launched Careem Bikes in Saudi Arabia. I was
                repsonsible for the development of commercial and operations
                email templates in Arabic. This opportunity enabled me to dive
                deep into Right-to-Left Language email templates, and their
                challenges.

                Careem web services must follow standard internal practices of
                thorough Monitoring and Observability. The responsiblity of
                implementing this lies with the Development team. This provided
                me with an opportunity to implement the monitoring and
                corresponding alerts using Grafana and Prometheus.

                Another dimension of my duties was to conduct hiring interviews

                My main reason to depart from Motive and join Rayn was to pull
                myself out of the comfort zone. Motive had set processes, that
                were architected and perfected long before I had joined Motive.
                After having spent more than 2 years in Motive, I had realized
                my growth and learning curve had flattened out. After discussing
                with my mentor, I took the decision and decided to join a much
                more challenging opportunity.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was hired at Rayn as the first frontend developer for
                <a
                  href="https://www.endpolio.com.pk"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener"
                  class="text-sky-600 font-bold"
                  >Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme</a
                >
                - the national Web Dashboard for live and legacy management of
                national polio campaigns. The foremost challenge that I
                encountered was a messy codebase written on need-basis by
                backend developers - that ran into bugs and breakdowns
                regularly. It was evident that the code won't scale, but it was
                essential to keep it running for mission-critical requirements
                as well. I kept the lights on, hoping for a downtime to come my
                way to solve the root cause. That break did come, in Ramdan of
                2023 wherein no polio campaigns were scheduled. I took that
                month long opportunity to tear down the codebase and re-write it
                from the root-level. The resultant code was much more
                self-explanatory, readable and scaleable. The bug and breakages
                count saw its lowest. I consider it as one of my major
                achievements in my career so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Rayn, I was also tasked with designing, implementing and
                streamlining dev processes - across Design, Frontend, Backend
                and QA.

                I can not be grateful enough for the opportunity to have worked
                at Motive. Motive enabled me at multiple fronts. I got to
                witness and experience how scale works. I wrote code, not only
                to deliver features, but also to understand and gauge how my
                code is being utilized.
              </p>
              <p>
                I spent most of the time in writing UI and integration layers,
                engaging heavily in peer reviews, authoring Technical Design
                Documents, delivering Knowledge Talks and conducting hiring
                interviews. I was also a part of the on-call rotation, and were
                part of 1 Production Fire-fighting session and authoring of a
                post-mortem report.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from core development work, I got to build a User
                Instrumentation pipeline using a combination of Pendo, Snowflake
                and Redis. We tracked user engagement using off-the-shelf and
                custom Pendo events. The said data was then queried with Redis
                to build engagement-specific dashboards. Working on this feature
                made me the go-to for anything tracking and I continued
                maintaining and evolving the tracking till the last day.

                Xgrid was my first workplace, my first job. I was
                super-fortunate with a first job that came with challenging work
                and great leaders who led with code and example. I met my mentor
